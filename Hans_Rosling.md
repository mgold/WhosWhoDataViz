# Hans Rosling

**Hans Rosling** is a Swedish professor of global health best known for his
**Gapminder** visualization of global progress over the last century. He often
presents this visualization live, with "a sportcaster's flair" and a trademark
pointing cue stick. The upshot of these jiggling, colorful bubbles is that
society in aggregate has seen dramatic improvements in quality of life over
several decades.

Rosling is a professor of global health at  Karolinska Institute, and is
[currently](https://twitter.com/HansRosling/status/524045174033616896) in
Liberia fighting Ebola at the request of the UN.
