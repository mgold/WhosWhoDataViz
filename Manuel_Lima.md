# Manuel Lima

**Manuel Lima** is an author and researcher concerned with trees and networks.
Unlike tabular data, networks are far more difficult to visualize in
traditional ways. However, much of the natural and social world exists as
networks. Lima is known for translating the web-like structures of ecology and
peer-to-peer interaction into dense visualizations.

Lima is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and Design Lead at Codecademy,
and is based in New York.
