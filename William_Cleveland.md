# William Cleveland

**William Cleveland** is a statistician who codified the construction of graphs
and charts. He used experimental psychophysics to determine what graphical
forms could easily be perceived and which could not, and then constructed new
charts like the dot plot to better suit human perception. [Jacques
Bertin](Historical/Jacques_Bertin.md) had conducted similar work but
unscientifically. Cleveland's books are technical and exacting, but they laid
the groundwork for more accessible guides like those of [Stephen
Few](Stephen_Few.md).

Cleveland is a professor of statistics at Purdue University.
