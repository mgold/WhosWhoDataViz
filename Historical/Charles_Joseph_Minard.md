# Charles Joseph Minard

**Charles Joseph Minard** (1781 - 1870) was a French civil engineer famous for 
his information graphic of Napoleon's losses in Russia. Published 1869, it was 
the last of his 51 "figurative maps". [Edward Tufte](../Edward_Tufte.md) says
that it "may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn" and studies it
for generalizable principles for an entire chapter of _Beautiful Evidence_. In
his day, his maps popularized the notion of information graphics and were
lauded for their clarity.
