# Charles Joseph Minard

**Charles Joseph Minard** (1781 - 1870) was a French civil engineer famous for
his information graphic of Napoleon's losses in Russia. The _Carte Figurative_,
published 1869, was the last of his 51 maps. [Edward Tufte](../Edward_Tufte.md)
says that it "may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn" and studies
it for generalizable principles for an entire chapter of _Beautiful Evidence_.
In his day, his maps popularized the notion of information graphics and were
lauded for their clarity.
