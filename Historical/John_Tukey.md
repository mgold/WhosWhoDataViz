# John Tukey

**John Tukey** (1915-2000) was a statistician at Bell Labs. He pioneered
"exploratory data analysis" (the title of his book), invented the box plot,
coined the term "bit", and devised the first efficient algorithm for the
Fourier transform. His Prim-9 computer allowed the viewing, rotating,
isolation, and masking of multidimensionsal data.
