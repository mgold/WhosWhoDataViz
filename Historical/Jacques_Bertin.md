# Jacques Bertin

**Jacques Bertin** (1919-2010) was a French cartographer known for establishing
the theoretical basis for information visualization. He established visually
distinct symbols that can be used for layered maps. He was the first to examine
human perception to improve the quality of graphics, and documented the
dimensions of visual shapes that can be perceived quantitatively and
qualitatively. These include size, color, orientation, and shape. Many of his
ideas would be reinvented decades later.

Bertin saw information graphics as a serious and intellectual affair. He held
that their value stemmed from their "double function as a storage mechanism and
a research instrument".
