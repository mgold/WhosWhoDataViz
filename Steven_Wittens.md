# Steven Wittens

**Steven Wittens** is known for his use of 2D and 3D animations as part of his
essays at acko.net. Some of his work focuses on advanced mathematics and
physics behind animation (including calculus, linear algebra, and signal
processing). Other pieces are descriptions (sometimes criticisms) of the
current state of web technology and Android usability. He has also written on
cultural issues, such as sexism and the current state of video games, in a
level-headed and thought-provoking way. Although Wittens's material is often of
great technical depth, it frequently showcases interactive animations
custom-made for explaining the topic at hand.

Wittens writes that "these days I am mostly found slinging JavaScript and GLSL,
with a little bit of Python, Ruby or C/C++ on the side."
