**John Maeda** is a designer and author, focusing on simplicity. He applies his
work to "design, technology, business, life" and has more recently focused on
leadership. His design ethos seeks to encompass a holistic view, not only of the
product, but also of the user. His advice is often abstract yet demanding.
