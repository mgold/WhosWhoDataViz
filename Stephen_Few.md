# Stephen Few

**Stephen Few** has written three books that detail the construction of tables,
graphs, at-a-glance dashboards, and interactive exploratory tools. He emphasizes
the human visual system (drawing on Colin Ware) as a guide for making effective
graphics; for example we can only perceive length and 2D area quantitatively,
and therefore pie charts should be avoided. He also provides a detailed taxonomy
of data: nominal, ordinal, interval, and hierarchical (for categorical data),
and ranking, ratio, and correlation (for quantities). He uses these distinctions
to guide the choice of visual encoding (e.g. correlation is best shown on a
scatterplot). His design advice is practical (if mundane), such as enforcing
consistency and ensuring properly alignment.

Few runs a consultancy known as [Perceptual
Edge](http://www.perceptualedge.com/).
