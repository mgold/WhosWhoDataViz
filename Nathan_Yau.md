# Nathan Yau

**Nathan Yau** is a data scientist and author. His style is often tutorial,
using Python and R to obtain, analyze, and visualize data (and D3 on the web).
His topics are often drawn from day-to-day society, e.g [miles to nearest
casino](http://flowingdata.com/2014/08/13/get-me-to-the-nearest-casino/) or
[multivariate beer](http://flowingdata.com/2014/10/02/multivariate-beer/). He
operates under the brand name **FlowingData**. He is unafraid to use an
unconventional visual encoding, and has produced many variants of geospatial
maps.

Yau has a Ph.D in statistics from UCLA.
