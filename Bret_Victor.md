# Bret Victor

**Bret Victor** is an visionary thought leader focusing on representations of
knowledge. His talks and essays feature working examples of creative
information and user interface designs, which have yet to be fully realized.
Much of his work focuses on immediate feedback and drawing dynamic images, and
aims to be relevant for decades. His work as a social and ethical dimension to
it, partially due to the rift between designers and engineers, even at his
former employer Apple. After one of his talks, an MIT professor told him, "It's
as if you showed us how to climb Everest, and then at the end you say, 'We need
to go to the moon.'"

Victor posts much of his work on his website. However, he has been extremely
secretive about his private life, and his current work and whereabouts are
unknown.
