# Douglas Engelbart

**Douglas Engelbart** (1925-2013) should be known as an inventor striving the
augment human intelligence. Although popularly known as the inventor of the
mouse, his oNLine System (NLS) was designed to promote collaborating in a
shared space. It organized information visually rather than textually, and
included complex navigation and transclusion of content. NLS was famously shown
at "the mother of all demos" on December 9, 1968. Although technologically
sophisticated, many of Engelbart's goals remain unattained.
