# Alberto Cairo

**Alberto Cairo** is a journalist, professor, author, and data visualization
designer know for his book and blog, _The Functional Art_. He advocates a
balanced approach to design and moderates between minimalism purist [Edward
Tufte ](Edward_Tufte.md) and the "chartjunk" or embellishments of Nigel Holmes.
Like [Stephen Few](Stephen_Few.md), Cairo spends a considerable portion of his
book on human perception and cognition. Cairo's work frequently includes
international and multilingual examples, many from print media.

Cairo is currently a professor at the University of Miami, School of
Communication and is also the director of the Visualization Program.
