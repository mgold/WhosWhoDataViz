Here are detailed profiles of many individuals listed, with more to be written.
You can learn more about a person's work, research, and books.

At the moment, everything is in Markdown. At some point I may try to add
numeric data and do some analytics, but those will only be as good as the data
they are built on.

If you think that I have described someone (or yourself) unfairly, please open
an issue and I will alter or remove the material quickly. This project is
compiled with the utmost respect for everyone profiled; I have something
to learn from all of them.
