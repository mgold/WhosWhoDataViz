# A Who's Who of Information Graphics

This is meant to be a reference guide to key figures in data visualization,
information design, business intelligence, and related fields. There is some
overlap into visual explanations, user-interface design, animation, and dynamic
images generally. It is done wholly unscientifically and without value
judgement. I'm doing this so I can better keep track of all of these people and
thereby better understand these fields, its differences of opinion, and where
it is going. We're at a unique point in the history of these fields, where many
good ideas are available but not yet universally adopted.

At the moment, everything is in Markdown. At some point I may try to add
numeric data and do some analytics, but those will only be as good as the data
they are built on.

This listing is hardly comprehensive, and still won't be once I get through my
list of people to add. As you can see by [this list of
resources](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2012/10/recommended-readings-for-infographics.html),
there's a lot more written on the subject than I can summarize. That's where
you come in:

## Can I help?

Sure! You are welcome to use pull requests or issues to correct any factual
errors, expand on the difficult-to-write descriptive paragraphs, or add new
relevant people. Just follow the existing pages for style consistency. You can
also suggest other types of information I should be keeping.

If you think that I have described someone (or yourself) unfairly, please open
an issue and I will alter or remove the material quickly. This project is
compiled with the utmost respect for everyone profiled; I have something
to learn from all of them.
