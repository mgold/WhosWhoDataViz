# A Who's Who of Information Graphics

This is meant to be a reference guide to key figures in data visualization,
information design, business intelligence, and related fields. There is some
overlap into visual explanations, user-interface design, animation, and dynamic
images generally. It is done wholly unscientifically and without value
judgement. I'm doing this so I can better keep track of all of these people so
that I can better understand the field, its differences of opinion, and where
it is going.

At the moment, everything is in Markdown. At some point I may try to add
numeric data and do some analytics, but those will only be as good as the data
they are built on.

## Can I help?

Sure! You are welcome to use pull requests or issues to correct any factual
errors, expand on the difficult-to-write descriptive paragraphs, or add new
relevant people. Just follow the existing pages for style consistency. You can
also suggest other types of information I should be keeping.

If you think that I have described someone (or yourself) unfairly, please open
an issue and I will alter or remove the material quickly. This project is
compiled with the utmost respect for everyone profiled; I have something
to learn from all of them.
