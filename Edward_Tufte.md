# Edward Tufte

**Edward Tufte** is perhaps the best-known thought leader in visual information
display. His four self-published books detail how graphics mislead, distort, or
obstruct data, and what can be done to fix them. In his erudite style, his books
describe far more the numeric data but also maps, both space shuttle disaters,
Gelileo, typography, art history, and nature. His statistics background and
calm-but-firm style insist on high-density displays of information.

Tufte oversees a scultpture farm in Cheshire, Connecticut, and gives one-day
classes a few times a year.
